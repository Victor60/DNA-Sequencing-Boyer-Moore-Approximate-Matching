##  DNA Sequencing Algorithms with Approximate Matching: Boyer-Moore, K-Mer Index, Pigeon-Hole.

Several DNA sequencing algorithms are coded in Python: 

* Generic Naive Approximate Matching allows up to n mismatches

* Boyer-Moore Pre-processing with approximate matching

* Pigeon Hole with Boyer-Moore and approximate matching

* Pigeon Hole with K-Mer Index and approximate matching

##  DNA Sequencing Algorithms: Boyer-Moore, Approximate-Matching, Pigeon-Hole.

Several DNA sequencing algorithms coded in Python: Boyer-Moore, Pigeon Hole, k-mer, Naive, Approximate Matching

* Generic Naive Approximate Matching allows up to n mismatches

* Boyer-Moore Pre-processing with approximate matching

* Pigeon Hole with K-Mer Index and approximate matching
